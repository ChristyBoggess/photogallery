									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>I am a student at Virginia Tech. In highschool I took two years of photography.
									Those classes taught me many skills about taking pictures and since then I have
								always enjoyed taking pictures. Fall is my favorite time of the year. The tempurature drops to the perfect degree, the trees begin to change, and it's time for football.
							I hope you enjoy these pictures.</p>
